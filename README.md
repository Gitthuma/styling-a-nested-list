Active learning: Styling a Nested List

In this active learning session, we want you to take what you've learned above and have a go at styling a nested list. We've provided you with the HTML, and we want you to:

1. Give the unordered list square bullets.
2. Give the unordered list items and the ordered list items a line-height of 1.5 of their font-size.
3. Give the ordered list lower alphabetical bullets.
4. Feel free to play with the list example as much as you like, experimenting with bullet types, spacing, or whatever else you can find.
